little bit about me
<p>
I am a fourth year Electrical and Computer Engineering student @ NEU in Boston, MA. I am currently working as a Machine Vision Intern at Scientific Systems and Company, Inc. in Woburn, MA. I am currently working with an amazing group of fellow students to build upon our HackBeanpot2019 project, Loot; a revolutionary commerce platform that utilizes fun game-like swiping gestures to determine a users interest in products.

What I do in my free time:
- Playing Volleyball
- Working out/ Going to the gym
- Enjoying art galleries
