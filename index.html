    <p>
    I am a fourth year Electrical and Computer Engineering student @ NEU in Boston, MA. I am currently working as a Machine Vision Intern at Scientific Systems and Company, Inc. in Woburn, MA. In my spare time, I am working with an amazing group of fellow students to build upon our HackBeanpot2019 project, Loot; a revolutionary commerce platform that utilizes fun game-like swiping gestures to determine a users interest in products.
